    * Rituals

      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
      | Name                                                           | TP Cost | Prep Time |
      +================================================================+=========+===========+
      | Time Warp                                                      |       5 |         2 |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
      | By creating a time distortion field around your opponent, you may make it difficult  |
      | for them to act. Targets of the field must make a successful Body+Reaction check to  |
      | continue taking action, or move to the bottom of the initiative track with a penalty |
      | to actions equal to the rounds of preparation taken. Sustaining this ritual requires |
      | conscious effort in the form of 2 AP per round                                       |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
      | Glass Jaw                                                      |       5 |         2 |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
      | By draining the body energy around your opponent, you make them unusually            |
      | susceptible to the attacks of others.  For each round of perpetration, the           |
      | opponent's damage threshold is lowered by 1.  The effect lasts until the target is   |
      | successfully damaged.                                                                |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
      | Glancing Blow                                                  |       5 |    1/Ally |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
      | By reciting an inspiring incantation, your allies gain the blessing of greater luck  |
      | in the avoidance of attacks.  At the minimum preparation, targeted allies are        |
      | allowed to dodge for free, instead of inuring a an AP cost.  Additional rounds of    |
      | preparation grant a +1 bonus per round.  Sustaining this ritual costs 2 AP per round |
      +----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
