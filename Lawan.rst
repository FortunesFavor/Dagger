**Traits/Rituals**

+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
| Name                                                           | TP Cost | Prep Time |
+==========================================================================+====+======+
| Time Warp                                                      |       5 |         2 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
| By creating a time distortion field around your opponent, you may make it difficult  |
| for them to act. Targets of the field must make a sucessful Body + Reaction check to |
| continue taking action, or move to the bottom of the initiative track with a penalty |
| to actions equal to the rounds of preparation taken. Sustaining this ritual requires |
| conscious effort in the form of 2 AP per round                                       |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
| Glass Jaw                                                      |       5 |         3 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------+---------+-----------+
| By draining the body energy around your opponent, you make them unusually suseptable |
| to the attacks of others.  For each round of perperation, the opponant's damage      |
| threshold is lowered by 2.  The effect lasts until the target is successfully        |
| damaged.                                                                             |

**Gear**
    * Poison Dagger [5DMG] [Free]
    
        After stabbing a target, you may spend 5AP to poison the target.  The poison drains 5 ap a round for 3 rounds.
    
    * Armored Leather Corset [15GP]
    * Potion Belt [10GP]

        for 2 AP in combat you can swig a potion from your belt without looking, or spend 5AP to glance down to make sure you get the right one.

        Effects include:

        * Breath of the Beast: Body related abilities are doubled for 5 turns
        * Bloodroot Draught: Reaction related abilities are doubled for 5 turns
        * Vision Spice: Perception rolls are made at +10, and you understand all languages spoken or written. Ethereal things become visible to you, though you may not understand them
        * Solution of Shadow: You become invisible for 5 turns
        * Oil of the Northborn: You berzerk for 5 turns, unable to take any action other than attack, but able to make 2 attacks per turn. If all of your enemies are dead, you will begin attacking your friends until the effect wears off
        * Black Blood brew: Drinking this potion gives you super human resistance to injury for exactly 1 turn
