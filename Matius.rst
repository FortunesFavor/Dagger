**Traits**
    * Trick Shot [5]

          With careful effort, Matius is able to rapid reload his gun, at a cost of 4AP per shot, and an incremental -2 penalty to each shot after the first. 

* Parry Expertise [5]

         At a cost of 5 AP, Matius is able to use his Melee Weapon DMG Rating as his Armor Rating to parry an attack, but loses the ability to attack the following turn

* Opportunist [5]

    On the round after an enemy has missed in a melee strike, Matius may spend 5AP to make an attack on the opponent that cannot be dodged and ignores Armor Rating. 

* Arcane Intuition [5]

    Having had brushes with ancient tomes of arcane knowledge, and artifacts of wondrous design, Matius is able to call on this knowledge to aid him. He is able to speak and read most languages upon first hearing them, understand the inner workings of ancient technologies, and has glimpses into ancient lore when dealing with artifacts or murals from lost civilizations. 

* Cantrips [5]

    With what little training Matius has had in thaumaturgy, he is able to perform simple parlor tricks, though they serve him well.
    Prestidigitation, Light, Detect Magic, Mending, Message, Minor Illusion, Break, Faerie Fire


**Gear**

    * Skeleton Key [Free]

          Able to open most mundane locks effortlessly, and magical locks with enough time (Taking multiple rounds in combat), this artifact of the God of Thieves was found in a vault in the Golden Palace. In addition to the aforementioned unlocking, it also has an ability costing 10AP to activate, that can create a doorway in solid matter to the nearest clearing, even if the doorway opens through hundreds of feet of soil or stone.

    *Wheellock Pistol [8]  

    This pistol does [8] DMG, but must be reloaded for [2 AP] before it can be fired again

*Rapier  [5]

    An ornate and nearly decorative sword, likely stolen from some collection, that does [5] DMG. 

*Leather Tunic [5]

    Basic leather armor providing Armor [1]


* Force Gauntlet[7]

    Grants the wearer telekinesis up to 100 lbs, and can be used to deflect projectiles at a cost of 10 AP. Objects thrown at opponents with the Gauntlet do [5] DMG, and knock the opponent down, requiring them to get back to their feet before they can attack, unable to make a move action that round
